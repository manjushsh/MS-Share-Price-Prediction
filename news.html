<p class="article__summary">U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, with major indexes slumping in a broad decline. While Wall Street posted a second straight positive week, the selloff heavily eroded the week's gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 0.8% to 24,463. The S&amp;P 500  lost 0.9% to 2,670. The Nasdaq Composite Index  ended down 1.3% to 7,146. For the week, the Dow rose 0.4%, the S&amp;P was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq rose 0.6%. All three closed below their 50-day moving average, a level used as a gauge for short-term momentum trends. Equities were pressured by a decline in Apple Inc. , which shed 4.1% amid cautious analyst commentary over its upcoming quarterly results. While 10 of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closed in negative territory, technology was among the biggest losers of the day, down 1.5%. Separately, investors dropped stocks as the yield for the benchmark 10-year Treasury note  rose to 2.96% and neared its highest since around 2014. </p>

<p class="article__summary">The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday was encountering intensifying selling pressure with less than an hour left of trading, with the blue chip gauge on the verge of giving up its weekly gain. Part of the blame for the downdraft accelerating was a rise of the yield in the benchmark 10-year Treasury note  to 2.96%, representing the highest since around 2014. Meanwhile, shares of Apple Inc.  were powering the decline, cutting about 50 points from the average. Most recently, the Dow  was down about 256 points, or 1%, with the benchmark hanging on to a weekly advance of about 0.2%. Apple's stock, off $7, or 4%, also was dragging the broader technology sector lower, with Dow component International Business Machines Corp. share [: IBM] slicing about 20 points from the average. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index  was taking the brunt of the intraday tumble among the main benchmarks, off 1.4%, at 7,138. The S&amp;P 500 index  was down 1% at 2,666, with tech  and the consumer-staples sectors  both off nearly 2%, leading losses in the broad-market index. The S&amp;P 500 was holding on to a weekly gain of 0.4%, while the Nasdaq boasts a rise over the 5-session period of 0.5%.   </p>

<p class="article__summary">U.S. stocks fell on Friday, with the S&amp;P 500 returning to negative territory for the year as losses accelerated in midday trading. The benchmark index  lost 0.8%, and is now down less than 0.1% for 2018 thus far. While the S&amp;P has been negative for the year multiple times in 2018, it had recently returned to the green. It has traded in positive territory for the year for the past four sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 0.8% on Friday, bringing its year-to-date move to a drop of 1%. The Nasdaq Composite Index  fell 1.1% on Friday, but remains up 3.7% for the year. The day's losses were widespread, pressured by weakness in the energy sector and by a sharp decline in Apple Inc. </p>

<p class="article__summary">The Dow Jones Industrial Average late-morning Friday was trading lower for a third straight session, with shares of Apple Inc., exacting the largest toll on the blue-chip gauge. Apple shares  were off 3.4%, or about $5.92, with the magnitude of the drop sapping about 40 points from the Dow  in early action. The Dow most recently was down 230 points, or 0.9%, at 24,438, while the S&amp;P 500 index  was off 0.8% at 2,670 and the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index  down 1.1% at 7,158. Apple's decline may be influenced by downbeat forecasts for the iPhone maker amid disappointment over chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , which lowered its revenue guidance range for the second quarter, citing weak demand for cell phones. That has led some Wall Street analysts to speculate that weakness in demand bodes ill for Apple Inc. . </p>

<p class="article__summary">U.S. stocks fell to session lows in late-morning trading on Friday, with the Nasdaq dropping 1% amid a steep decline in Apple stock. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 0.8% while the S&amp;P 500  lost 0.7% and the Nasdaq  fell 1%, falling to its lows of the day. Among the biggest drags of the day was Apple Inc. , which shed 3.5% ahead of the company's upcoming quarterly results. Analysts have expressed some caution about the strength of the results, which will be released in early May. The energy sector also weighed on indexes, falling 1% after President Donald Trump tweeted that crude-oil prices were "artificially high." </p>

<p class="article__summary">Shares of Apple Inc.  are down 2.6% in Friday morning trading after a pair of analysts issued cautious notes ahead of the company's second-quarter earnings report, due out in early May. Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty lowered her price target on the stock to $200 from $203, writing that she expects the company to deliver in-line results for the March period but that she also sees "downside to June consensus estimates following iPhone build cuts and weak China data." Canaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley wrote Friday that his recent consumer survey "indicates slow iPhone sales ahead of new product launches." He said that the $1,000-plus price point for the iPhone X "has been a greater deterrent for broad market appeal than anticipated," while the phone's screen size isn't large enough to have wide appeal in the Chinese market. Walkley rates the stock a buy with a $200 price target. Apple's stock fell in Thursday's session as well, after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd.  delivered downbeat June-quarter guidance. Shares of Apple are up 18% over the past 12 months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has gained 20%. </p>

<p class="article__summary">Shares of Apple Inc.  suppliers are down in Thursday trading, as is the chip sector more broadly, after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd.  trimmed its June-quarter guidance. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh issued a note to clients Thursday afternoon entitled "Buy the Semis with the Least Apple Exposure," in which he recommended automotive names as well as Intel Corp.  and Micron Technology Inc. . "We believe with some of the semi names down 6% today with zero or &lt;5% exposure to Apple, we would be buyers on ON Semiconductor Corp. , Autoliv Inc.  and Cypress Semiconductor Corp.  as Automotive continues to trend well," he wrote. "We remain buyers of Intel and Micron as data center continues to trend well and Apple is less than 10% of revenue." Rakesh said that pricing for DRAM and NAND are up "despite the much more pronounced demand weakness." The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 4.4% in Thursday's session, while the S&amp;P 500  is down 0.9%. </p>

It has traded in positive territory for the year for the past four sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 0.8% on Friday, bringing its year-to-date move to a drop of 1%. The Nasdaq Composite Index  fell 1.1% on Friday, but remains up 3.7% for the year. The day's losses were widespread, pressured by weakness in the energy sector and by a sharp decline in Apple Inc. </p>

<p class="article__summary">The Dow Jones Industrial Average late-morning Friday was trading lower for a third straight session, with shares of Apple Inc., exacting the largest toll on the blue-chip gauge. Apple shares  were off 3.4%, or about $5.92, with the magnitude of the drop sapping about 40 points from the Dow  in early action. The Dow most recently was down 230 points, or 0.9%, at 24,438, while the S&amp;P 500 index  was off 0.8% at 2,670 and the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index  down 1.1% at 7,158. Apple's decline may be influenced by downbeat forecasts for the iPhone maker amid disappointment over chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , which lowered its revenue guidance range for the second quarter, citing weak demand for cell phones. That has led some Wall Street analysts to speculate that weakness in demand bodes ill for Apple Inc. . </p>

<p class="article__summary">U.S. stocks fell to session lows in late-morning trading on Friday, with the Nasdaq dropping 1% amid a steep decline in Apple stock. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 0.8% while the S&amp;P 500  lost 0.7% and the Nasdaq  fell 1%, falling to its lows of the day. Among the biggest drags of the day was Apple Inc. , which shed 3.5% ahead of the company's upcoming quarterly results. Analysts have expressed some caution about the strength of the results, which will be released in early May. The energy sector also weighed on indexes, falling 1% after President Donald Trump tweeted that crude-oil prices were "artificially high." </p>

<p class="article__summary">Shares of Apple Inc.  are down 2.6% in Friday morning trading after a pair of analysts issued cautious notes ahead of the company's second-quarter earnings report, due out in early May. Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty lowered her price target on the stock to $200 from $203, writing that she expects the company to deliver in-line results for the March period but that she also sees "downside to June consensus estimates following iPhone build cuts and weak China data." Canaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley wrote Friday that his recent consumer survey "indicates slow iPhone sales ahead of new product launches." He said that the $1,000-plus price point for the iPhone X "has been a greater deterrent for broad market appeal than anticipated," while the phone's screen size isn't large enough to have wide appeal in the Chinese market. Walkley rates the stock a buy with a $200 price target. Apple's stock fell in Thursday's session as well, after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd.  delivered downbeat June-quarter guidance. Shares of Apple are up 18% over the past 12 months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has gained 20%. </p>

<p class="article__summary">Shares of Apple Inc.  suppliers are down in Thursday trading, as is the chip sector more broadly, after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd.  trimmed its June-quarter guidance. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh issued a note to clients Thursday afternoon entitled "Buy the Semis with the Least Apple Exposure," in which he recommended automotive names as well as Intel Corp.  and Micron Technology Inc. . "We believe with some of the semi names down 6% today with zero or &lt;5% exposure to Apple, we would be buyers on ON Semiconductor Corp. , Autoliv Inc.  and Cypress Semiconductor Corp.  as Automotive continues to trend well," he wrote. "We remain buyers of Intel and Micron as data center continues to trend well and Apple is less than 10% of revenue." Rakesh said that pricing for DRAM and NAND are up "despite the much more pronounced demand weakness." The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 4.4% in Thursday's session, while the S&amp;P 500  is down 0.9%. </p>
